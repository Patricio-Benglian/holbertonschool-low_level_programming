# Time Complexity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Time Complexity** is the amount of **time** it takes an algorithm to run based on the input. 

## Big O (O) Notation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big O denotes the worst case scenario for time complexity. For example, an array that is completely unsorted or searching for an element in a list that happens to be at the very end of that list.
## Big Omega (Ω) Notation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big Ω denotes the best case scenario for time complexity. For example, an array is already sorted, or searching for an element in a list that happens to be at the very beginning of that list, or that list being 1 element long.
## Big Theta (Θ) Notation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big Θ denotes the average case scenario for time complexity. For example, a randomly shuffled deck of cards that needs to be sorted by number or searching for someone in a phone book who is somewhere in the middle are all average cases.

# Space Complexity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Space Complexity** is the amount of **memory**, storage or space used by a program based on the input.

An example O(1) **Space Complexity** would be an algorithm that utilizes just 3 pointers to elements no matter the same of the array.
